### DESCRIPTION:  In this project I created two different web maps. The first map (pop_density.html) shows the density of each state in the United States represented in people per square mile. The second map (index.html) shows the amount of people vaccinated per every 10k in each county in Washington State. Both maps are interactive, so when you hover over a state or county the value assocaited for that region will appear in the box on the upper right of the map. The legend for both maps appear in the lower right corner of the map. I chose the color scheme light green to dark green to represent the scale for people vacinated because green is considered by many to symbolize safety. The greener the county the more individuals vaccinated per 10k, so the safer the county is from COVID 19.
